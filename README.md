## How the EncDec works
EncDec works by taking two inputs from user the user:
- Shift🔑: This is a non-negative integer value that acts as a key, showing the number of spaces a character is shifted to the right or left, depending on users command.
- Message💬: This is the actual message to be encrypted🔐 or decrypted🔓 using the provided shift(key).
- Button Click: The user is required to command the app on what to do with the message, by either clicking on encrypt button to cipher the entered message or decrypt button to decipher.

If everything above goes well, the app outputs the final message.
